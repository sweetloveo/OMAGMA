<h2>This route is fast to load</h2>

<p>
  This route has no resolve method, so the loader doesn't appear but you can always
  customize the <b>latency</b> attribute of the module specifing it to the directive.
  <br>The default latency is <b>250ms</b> the module will wait that time before show the loader.
  <br>See the <a href="https://github.com/codekraft-studio/angular-page-loader">github</a> page to see how it works and how to customize it.
